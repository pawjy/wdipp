* Running the server

As a locally running server (for devs):

  $ git clone https://github.com/wakaba/wdipp
  $ cd wdipp
  $ ./lserver

XXX port

* Processors

A processor is the implementation of an HTTP end point.

A processor has a unique name, which is a string of one or more
characters in the range [0-9A-Za-z_].

** Defining a processor

XXX processor's code

  key : String?

    The processor's signing key.  If omitted, no signature is used for
    this processor.

  timeout : Seconds?

    The number of seconds of process's timeout.  If omitted, defaulted
    to 60 (seconds).

** Invoking a processor

A processor can be invoked by sending an HTTP |GET| request to the
wdipp server with the URL path |/{name}| where {name} is the
processor's name.

If the |arg| parameter is specified, the first parameter value,
decoded as a UTF-8 string, is used as the argument string.  Otherwise,
the argument string is set to the empty string.

If the processor uses the signature (i.e. the processor's signing key
is specified in the processor's definition's |key|), the |signature|
parameter must be set to the signature.  The signature is:

  base64 (hmac_sha1 (utf8 (/arg/), utf8 (/key/)))

... where:

  /arg/        The argument string.
  /key/        The processor's signing key.
  utf8 ()      UTF-8 encode <https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-8-encode>.
  hmac_sha1 () RFC 2104 HMAC-SHA1 signature algorithm.
  base64 ()    Forgiving-base64 encode
               <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#forgiving-base64-encode>.

The processor's code is invoked with the argument string on an empty
document.

The processor's code is expected to return a JavaScript object, or
return a |Promise|, which is to be resolved with a JavaScript object.
That object is interpreted as the result object.

If the processor's code throws, or returns a |Promise| but it is
rejected, a |500| error response is returned.  The processor's code
should not throw or reject.

A result object is a JavaScript object with following name/value
pairs:

  content : Object

    A JavaScript object with following name/value pairs:

      type : "text" | "screenshot"

        The type of the response.  Required.

      targetElement : Selector?

        A group of selectors, used to select an element in the
        document tree.  Required and allowed if |type| is
        |screenshot|.

        The response is a PNG image, which is a screenshot of the
        selected element.

      value : String?

        The text.  Required and allowed if |type| is |text|.

        The response is a UTF-8 plain text whose string value is
        |value|.

  httpCache : Object?

    A JavaScript object with following name/value pairs:

      maxAge : Integer?

        The lifetime of the response.  If specified, a |cache-control:
        public, max-age=/age/| response header, where /age/ is the
        |maxAge| value, is added.

  statusCode : Number

    An HTTP status code within the range 200-599.  If omitted,
    defaulted to 200.

* Configuration file

The wdipp server must be started with a configuration file, its path
specified in the |CONFIG_FILE| environment variable.

A configuration file is a JSON file, which contains a JSON object with
following name/value paris:

  accessControlAllowOrigins: Array

    XXX

  is_live : Boolean

    Whether the wdipp server is running in the live (or production)
    mode.

  is_local : Boolean

    Whether the wdipp server is running in the local mode
    (i.e. running within the developer's local environment).

  is_test_script : Boolean

    Whether the wdipp server is running as part of a test script's
    setup.

  processors : Object

    XXX

  processors_dir : Path to the directory

    XXX

  wd_url : Absolute URL whose scheme is |http:| or |https:|

    The absolute URL of the root directory of the WebDriver server
    used by the wdipp server.
