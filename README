wdipp
~~~~~

* Running the server

As a locally running server (for devs):

  $ git clone https://github.com/wakaba/wdipp
  $ cd wdipp
  $ ./lserver

XXX port

* Processors

A processor is the implementation of an HTTP end point.

A processor has a unique name, which is a string of one or more
characters in the range [0-9A-Za-z_].

** Defining a processor

XXX processor's code

** Invoking a processor

A processor can be invoked by sending an HTTP |GET| request to the
wdipp server with the URL path |/{name}| where {name} is the
processor's name.

If the |arg| parameter is specified, the first parameter value,
decoded as a UTF-8 string, is used as the argument string.  Otherwise,
the argument string is set to a JavaScript value |null|.

The processor's code is invoked with the argument string on an empty
document.

The processor's code is expected to return a JavaScript object, or
return a |Promise|, which is to be resolved with a JavaScript object.
That object is interpreted as the result object.

If the processor's code throws, or returns a |Promise| but it is
rejected, a |500| error response is returned.  The processor's code
should not throw or reject.

A result object is a JavaScript object with following name/value
pairs:

  content : Object

    A JavaScript object with following name/value pairs:

      type : "text" | "screenshot"

        The type of the response.  Required.

      targetElement : Selector?

        A group of selectors, used to select an element in the
        document tree.  Required and allowed if |type| is
        |screenshot|.

        The response is a PNG image, which is a screenshot of the
        selected element.

      value : String?

        The text.  Required and allowed if |type| is |text|.

        The response is a UTF-8 plain text whose string value is
        |value|.

  httpCache : Object?

    A JavaScript object with following name/value pairs:

      maxAge : Integer?

        The lifetime of the response.  If specified, a |cache-control:
        public, max-age=/age/| response header, where /age/ is the
        |maxAge| value, is added.

  statusCode : Number

    An HTTP status code within the range 200-599.  If omitted,
    defaulted to 200.

* Configuration file

The wdipp server must be started with a configuration file, its path
specified in the |CONFIG_FILE| environment variable.

A configuration file is a JSON file, which contains a JSON object with
following name/value paris:

  accessControlAllowOrigins: Array

    XXX

  is_live : Boolean

    Whether the wdipp server is running in the live (or production)
    mode.

  is_local : Boolean

    Whether the wdipp server is running in the local mode
    (i.e. running within the developer's local environment).

  is_test_script : Boolean

    Whether the wdipp server is running as part of a test script's
    setup.

  processors : Object

    XXX

  processors_dir : Path to the directory

    XXX

  wd_url : Absolute URL whose scheme is |http:| or |https:|

    The absolute URL of the root directory of the WebDriver server
    used by the wdipp server.
